## Response snapshot

The implementation of Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) has been completed successfully. All tasks from the tasks.md file have been executed, resulting in:

1. Created module directory structure at physicalAI-book/docs/module-2/
2. Updated sidebar configuration in sidebars.js to include the new module
3. Created module overview page at physicalAI-book/docs/module-2/index.md
4. Created three chapter files:
   - Chapter 2.1 — Gazebo Physics Simulation (1,709 words)
   - Chapter 2.2 — Sensor Simulation (1,917 words)
   - Chapter 2.3 — Unity Digital Twin Visualization (1,245 words)
5. All chapters include required exercises and APA-formatted references
6. All chapters meet the word count requirements (1,200-3,000 words each)
7. Docusaurus build completed successfully with no errors

The implementation followed the planned phases: Setup, Foundational, User Stories 1-3, and Polish. All 32 tasks have been marked as completed in the tasks.md file. The documentation is properly integrated into the Docusaurus site navigation and meets the constitution requirements for content length, exercises, and references.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully implemented Module 2 with three comprehensive chapters on digital twin simulation
- 🧪 Tests: Docusaurus build completed successfully with no errors
- 📁 Files: Created 4 documentation files, updated sidebar configuration, marked all tasks as completed
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for Module 3 implementation or content review
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation followed the task plan effectively, all constitution requirements met
