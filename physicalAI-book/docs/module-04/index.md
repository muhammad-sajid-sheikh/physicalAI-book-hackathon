# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

This module covers the convergence of vision, language, and action in robotics, focusing on how large language models (LLMs) can enable natural human-robot interaction for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Implement voice command processing for humanoid robots
- Design cognitive planning systems using LLMs for robotic task execution
- Integrate vision, language, and action components into a complete VLA pipeline

## Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Experience with ROS 2 and simulation environments
- Understanding of AI perception pipelines
- Basic knowledge of natural language processing concepts

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three progressive chapters:
1. **Voice-to-Action Processing**: Speech recognition fundamentals and ROS 2 integration
2. **Cognitive Planning with LLMs**: Using large language models for task planning
3. **Autonomous Humanoid Capstone**: Complete VLA pipeline integration
