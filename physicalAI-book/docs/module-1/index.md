# Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for humanoid robots.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- The fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture
- How to work with ROS 2 using Python (rclpy)
- How to model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

This module lays the foundation for understanding how AI agents communicate with physical robots, bridging the gap between decision-making algorithms and real-world robotic actions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
2. Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes using Python
3. Design simple robot models using URDF

## Chapters

This module contains the following chapters:

1. [Chapter 1.1 — ROS 2 Architecture](./chapter-1-1.md)
2. [Chapter 1.2 — ROS 2 with Python (rclpy)](./chapter-1-2.md)
3. [Chapter 1.3 — URDF & Humanoid Modeling](./chapter-1-3.md)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- A working ROS 2 installation (Humble Hawksbill or later recommended)
