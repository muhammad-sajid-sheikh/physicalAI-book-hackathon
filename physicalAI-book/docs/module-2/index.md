# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on digital twin technology using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for visualization, creating a comprehensive simulation environment for humanoid robots.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- How to create realistic physics simulations in Gazebo
- How to simulate various sensors (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs) that publish ROS 2 data
- How to visualize robot state in real-time using Unity

This module bridges the gap between simulation and real-world robotics by providing tools to create high-fidelity digital representations of physical robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1. Set up and configure Gazebo for humanoid robot simulation
2. Implement sensor simulation with realistic data publication
3. Create Unity visualizations that reflect real-time robot state
4. Integrate simulation components with ROS 2

## Chapters

This module contains the following chapters:

1. [Chapter 2.1 — Gazebo Physics Simulation](./chapter-2-1.md)
2. [Chapter 2.2 — Sensor Simulation](./chapter-2-2.md)
3. [Chapter 2.3 — Unity Digital Twin Visualization](./chapter-2-3.md)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic knowledge of ROS 2 concepts
- Understanding of robot kinematics and dynamics
- A working installation of Gazebo and Unity
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts
