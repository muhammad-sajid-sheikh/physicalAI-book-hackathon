# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on the AI-Robot brain using NVIDIA Isaac, which serves as the cognitive system for humanoid robots.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- How to use Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- How to implement Isaac ROS perception pipelines with hardware acceleration
- How to configure Nav2 for humanoid robot navigation

This module builds on the previous modules to provide a complete AI-Robot brain that bridges the gap between perception, cognition, and action in humanoid robotics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1. Set up and configure Isaac Sim for high-fidelity robotic simulation
2. Implement Isaac ROS perception pipelines leveraging hardware acceleration
3. Configure Nav2 for humanoid robot navigation with proper kinematic constraints
4. Integrate Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 for complete AI-Robot brain functionality

## Chapters

This module contains the following chapters:

1. [Chapter 3.1 — Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data](./chapter-3-1.md)
2. [Chapter 3.2 — Isaac ROS Perception](./chapter-3-2.md)
3. [Chapter 3.3 — Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation](./chapter-3-3.md)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic knowledge of ROS 2 concepts
- Understanding of robot simulation principles
- A working installation of Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Navigation2
- Familiarity with 3D simulation environments
